 Hello everyone, I’m @Koglerune
  
 I am coding since ı was 10 but obviously as a stupid child couldnt make
 a clear path for myself didnt gain deeep knowledge about coding on those years 
 and stuck in trying to code games which ı dont wanna do it anymore :B

 Now ı am 21 years old and trying to compansate those years ı wasted.
 Didnt add any projects to github until now but gonna add even the smallest things here
 (date ı am writing this is 6 november 2024 btw)

 I’m currently trying to learn how to work on multilanguage projects. ( something ı wasnt able to do while coding games :B )
 And in the mean time ı am trying to write a doom clone in c++. Because why not, also makes me learn 3d projection
 
 you can reach me by sending mails to enesulutas33@gmail.com
